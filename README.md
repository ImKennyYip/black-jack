# This is the first in a series of builds of this Blackjack project.

Since this the first projects in the series, I have a general vision of how I see the future of this projects progressing but will veer from this plan as necessary if I develop any ideas along the way that may warrant implementation:

1. Code Blackjack game using Vanilla Javascript.
2. Build code logic to have an option to split, and develop a the first attempt at card counting.
3. I wanted get React by Step 2 given that I prefer to spend more time in React framework than Vanilla Javascript for choice, but I do think it is worth it overall as that will be very good practive in deeper Javascript logic and has no impact at all on styling. Step 2 will be the starting point for Step 3. The first step is to create a react version of the application via npm or vite. Then I will develop sound components and structure them in an efficient heirachy. Lastly, I will implement some minor styling and decide on whether or to implement Tailwind CSS or stick with vanilla styling.
4. Build logic for advanced card counting methodologies by introducing a deck depth quantitiy variable which seems a little overwhelming right now as my mental alarm bells go ringing on all that needs to be taken into consideration that I currently do not even know how the system works on the dealer side with when they have to move onto the next decks in terms of amount of cards left in the deck to deal to the table or move to next deck, when they shuffle, ideas like bringing in additional players and taking their cards into consideration and maybe even cooberation, and scaling bets depending on when there are hot odds in your favor.
5. Develop the back-end using blockchain technology. I am doing this to become a Blockchain Developer, after all.
6. Deploy the web site to GitHub, a private domain using Hostinger, and add to my portfolio.

Many thanks to Kenny Ip for his inspiration to begin this fun little series and for letting me begin without worrying about creating images for an entire deck of cards! Original project details below. Given the minimal styling changes, the projects may appear similar, but as I develop these projects as stated above, in the end they will be very different.

One consistent theme I have heard over and over again is to pick a game or topic that you find interesting. I have never dove too deep into the Blackjack waters, but have found the game, especially the card counting aspect, totally fascinating so I have no excuse not to make the most out of this little series.
